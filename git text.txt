vs code supports the html, javascript,html,type text
open source
fire base
netify
git and GitHub
git-lab
bit-bucket
fire base is developed by google
to deploy the firebase
authrentication google 
fire base is multitasker
fire base is used for real time database
netifty
it easy to use
aws is also known as virtual network
git is track the code
git-hub is used the store and manage the code
git is version controller
git-hub is cloud storage
how to use
install git-bash
or
command- prompt
or vs-code
 
git is divided into two
local local repo
git-hub(cloud)

connect to local repo to vs code in git we use command git init
local repo has been divide into two
un -tracked files(unstaged) operations are create,delete,update
tracked files(staged) 
converting untracked files to tracked files is command
git add file-name
or
git add.
and
git commit -m""
difference between git add. and git commit
git add . individual file is add
establish communication between local repo git-hub command 
git remote add origin http-path
git push-u origin master/main
u stands for upstring
clone is means copy

react native is used to develop mobile application 
electron js is used to develop desktop application 
react js is used to develop web application

what is JavaScript?
A) it used to convert static page to dynamic page


VARIABLES IN JS
 set of block it is used to store the data 
PRIMITIVE DATA TYPES
number
string
Boolean
un defined
null
delete
non - primitive data types 
class 
array 
map
object
functions

null data type is object
at end of the day javascript is represent in object 
 in javascript variables are in dynamic nature(no need data type)
eg: var a = 10

SCOPES in varaibles
1) global scope - we can declare outside function we can access inside the function
2) local -scope /script -scope 
3)block scope it mite be any variable 

VARIABLES TYPES IN JAVASCRIPT
let 
var
const 
let is reinsalation and redeclaration is not possible
var is reinsalation and redeclaration is possible
1) static websites : remains same to everyone 
ex: fb login
2) dynamic websites : changes to everyone(data)
1) ex: youtube
criczbuzz
google maps # time-time # 
Varaibles :
1) static typed and dynamic type:
2) varaibles are used store the data 
3) case- sensitive 
4) start with letters ,-,$(dollar)
5) can start with numbers
6) reserved words
7) allow letters ,-(under_score),$ (dollarsign),numbers
how to declare variables 
var 
let 
const
1) var keyword 1995-2015
2) let keyword 2015
3) var used only

</html> it is resassiging problem
resassigning possible in let aslo accepted
reassigining with const not accepted 
redeclaring
redeclaring with let not possible 
EXAMPLE: 
let a=1;
let a=5;
document.write(a+a);
const.log(a+a);
recdeclaring with var is accepted
recdeclaring with const is not accepted

Data Types
1) dynamic type language 
two types
1) primitive data type
2) non-primitive data types : objects ,arrays


1) primitive data types : predefined ; we can store single values
1) Numbers : integers ,floats
2) string : stream of characters enclosed in quotes
-- single ,double, backtick quotes ;
3) Boolean : true or false
4) null : empty value or no value 
5) undefined ---- declared variable with no value


2) strings : stream of characters enclosed in quotes
-- single double quotes works same
-- single and double quotes works same
-- back ticks introduced in ES6 version
-- it provides

output : hi + a+a
hi + 2

string concatenation:
a=sai
b= kumar 
age = 30
let c= 
output : i am sai kumar ,my age is 30 years old
